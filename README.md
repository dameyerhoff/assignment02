Reflection

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

(Answer) I feel I met all of the essential requirements. And a couple of extra ones (controlling the text size on a mobile phone)

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

(Answer) I managed to add a scroll-marker-group (just below the gallery) but it only seems to work when adding images to the carousel via html method. As soon as I added images to the container via a javascript loop function - it just wouldn't have it. When i inspect the page, the scroll marker group is there, but it displays no markers. I hope you'll be able to show me where I've gone wrong here. Also, I was unable to tweak the code to scroll through each image seperately. On mine, when you press the scroll button it scrolls to the start position of whichever image is not fully showing on the screen. And then you must click each image to display it in large below. Again, I would greatly appreciate some time with Sam or Connor to help me understand further where I need to tweak this code to do this.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

(Answer) I found the second example of a (for) loop function MUCH easier to get my head around than the (for each) loop function. So, I will probably fall back on using that method for the time being.

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission.

(Answer) I'm not gunna lie, I found the early aspects of this one very tricky. But I hope as I gain more experience over these weeks, I will look back at these tasks (and my reflections) and I will see how far my knowledge has grown. I keep reminding myself that we are only 2 weeks into this course, and I've never touched Javascript before in my life. So it's just a case of me now, getting used to repeating these same processes over and over again, and getting better with all the terminology of it all, especially when I'm wanting to ask you questions and use the right words for what I'm trying to ask. I spend a lot of my spare time re-watching the class tutorials and making my own notes alongside them. Because difficult or not, I do love coding, and I'm determined that no matter how hard it can all feel sometimes, I'm only 2 weeks in, and I'm too hard on myself.
